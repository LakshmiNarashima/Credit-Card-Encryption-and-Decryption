# Credit Card Encryption and Decryption

This project is a **web-based application** designed to securely **encrypt and decrypt credit card information**. Using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with CBC mode, this application ensures that sensitive data remains secure. Built with Python and Flask, it allows users to input a credit card number, encrypt it, and decrypt it on-demand.

## Project Overview

The **Credit Card Encryption and Decryption** system provides secure handling of credit card information by encrypting card numbers before storage and decrypting them only when necessary. This can be extended to securely store encrypted data in a cloud environment for persistent storage.

### Key Concepts:

- **AES Encryption (CBC mode)**: Used for strong encryption and decryption of credit card data.
- **Flask Web Framework**: Used to create a web interface that users can interact with to encrypt and decrypt data.
- **Access Control**: Allows encryption/decryption operations, ensuring secure handling of sensitive information.

## Features

- **Encrypt Credit Card Numbers**: Users can input a credit card number, which is then encrypted using AES encryption.
- **Decrypt Encrypted Data**: Users can enter encrypted data and retrieve the original credit card number.
- **Flash Messages**: Displays encryption and decryption results or errors if the input data is invalid.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Flask**: Web framework for creating the user interface.
- **PyCryptodome**: Python library for cryptographic functions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-encryption.git
   cd credit-card-encryption
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Use `pip` to install Flask and PyCryptodome.
   ```bash
   pip install flask pycryptodome
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. **Access the Web App**:
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` to access the interface.

## Usage

1. **Encrypting a Credit Card Number**:
   - Enter a credit card number in the **Encrypt** section and click **Encrypt**.
   - The application will display the encrypted data on the page.

2. **Decrypting Encrypted Data**:
   - Copy the encrypted data.
   - Paste it into the **Decrypt** section and click **Decrypt**.
   - The application will display the original credit card number.

### Example

#### Input
- Credit Card Number: `1234567812345678`

#### Encrypted Output
- Encrypted Data: `kLr3jdRX9VblFH+Zg0o2fjks8HZwRY==`

#### Decrypted Output
- Original Number: `1234567812345678`
